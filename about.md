## Who are you?

Rope Yarns is run by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rope_yarns/" target="_blank"> Benjamin Klein</a>.
He started learning with <a href="{{ site.ropetales }}" target="_blank">Rope Tales</a> in Milano in 2018. Fascinated by Japanese bondage, also called kinbaku or shibari, he is actively studying and believes good bondage starts with the exploration of our intentions.

## Is this shibari, or kinbaku?

What we are teaching is inherited from Japanese rope bondage that evolved from the end of the 19th to nowadays, and which is called shibari, or kinbaku.

## What style are you tying?

It would be presumptuous to say we are tying in the style of anyone in particular, and we are not endorsed to do so. However we need to give credit: nearly everything that we are studying comes from the Italian riggers  <a href="{{ site.riccardo-ig }}" target="_blank">Riccardo Wildties</a>, <a href="{{ site.kiri-ig }}" target="_blank">Federico Kirigami</a>, and <a href="{{ site.kuro-ig }}" target="_blank">Andrea Kurogami</a>, who are all inspired by the work of Japanese rigger <a href="{{ site.naka-ig }}" target="_blank">Akira Naka</a>.

## Do I need to bring rope to class?

We provide you with the rope you need for every introductory or beginner class.

## What should I wear to class?

The clothes you wear should be comfortable. To be tied, we advise you to avoid clothes made of rigid or slippery fabrics, like jeans or slippery leggings. A pair of Leggings with a cottony feel and a t-shirt are a good choice.
